# Gossip Glomers Challenges
This repo contains my solutions to the [fly.io gossip glomers distributed systems challenges](https://fly.io/dist-sys/)

If you'd like to test these:
  - [Install the Maelstrom prereqs](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/01-getting-ready/index.md#prerequisites)
  - [Download the latest Maelstrom package and unpack it](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/01-getting-ready/index.md#prerequisites)
  - Use the instructions provided in the README of each folder of this repo to run the Maelstrom tests for that challenge
